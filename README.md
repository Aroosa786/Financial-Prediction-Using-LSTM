# Financial-Prediction-Using-LSTM
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. This is a practical implementation of deep learning in the financial domain, focusing on time series forecasting using TensorFlow/Keras.
# Overview
To explore the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting the closing prices of a given stock.
# Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Sequence generation for LSTM input
- LSTM model creation and training
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices
# Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
# Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aroosa786/Financial-Prediction-Using-LSTM.git
# Results
- The model captures general trends and short-term movements reasonably well. Further tuning and feature engineering could improve performance.
#  To-Do
 - Add more advanced features (e.g., technical indicators)
 - Tune hyperparameters
 - Test on other tickers
